Lab 1 due 02/01/2017
Professor Scott
TA: Garrett

Notes about operation:
	1)once you open the .html file just left click with the mouse on the screen to let the keyboard operations start

	2)the + key that is used is SHIFT and the = key, I donot have the + key by itself on my keyborad thus that it what I used so that I can check that is 
	working 

That is what I did in that Lab:
	1) (DONE) Implement the assignment in a clean and understandable manner. Your code must be readily understandable for grading including extensive comments. 
	A README.md that explains what you did (i.e. extra credit) and anything the grader needs to know to run your assignment – 5 points.
 
	2)(DONE) Set up a WebGL capable HTML canvas able to display without error. Its size should be at least 960x540 and should have the z-buffer enabled and 
	cleared to a black background. Implement necessary shader codes without error – 5 points. ** Note: I did it 960x960

	3)(DONE) Display eight (8) unit cubes using a symmetric perspective projection. Each of the eight cubes should be centered at (+/- 10, +/- 10, +/- 10) from 
	the origin. Each of the eight cubes should be drawn with a different color. You can use any colors except black or white. All eight cubes should be visible
	from an initial camera position along the Z axis - 20 points.

	5)(DONE) The ‘c’ key should cycle the colors between the cubes - 5 points.

	6)(DONE) The cubes should display in a square aspect ratio (they should not be stretched or squeezed when displayed) – 5 points.
 
	7)(DONE) Implement a simple camera navigation system using the keyboard. Up and down arrow keys should control the position of the camera along the Y axis 
	(+Y is up and -Y is down by default in WebGL). Each key press should adjust position by 0.25 units. - 5 points.

	8)(DONE) The left and right arrow keys control the heading (azimuth, like twisting your neck to say 'no') of the camera. Each key press should rotate the 
	heading by four (4) degrees - 10 points.

	9)(DONE) The letters i, j, k and m control forward, left, right and backward, respectively, relative to the camera's current heading. Each key press should
	adjust position by 0.25 units. The ‘r’ key should reset the view to the start position (recall, the start position is defined only in that all cubes are 
	visible and the eye be positioned along the Z axis) – 20 points.

	10)(DONE) The ‘n’ and ‘w’ keys should adjust the horizontal field of view (FOV) narrower or wider. One (1) degree per key press. Keep the display of your 
	scene square as the FOV changes - 5 points.

	11)(DONE)The ‘+’ key should toggle the display of an orthographic projection of a cross hair centered over your scene. The cross hairs themselves can be a 
	simple set of lines rendered in white – 5 points.
 
Extra Credit:

	1)(DONE) Instance each of the eight cubes from the same geometry data - 5 points.

	2)(DONE) Implement the cube geometry as a single triangle strip primitive – 5 points.

	3)(DONE) Implement your navigation system rotations using quaternions - 5 points.

	4)(DONE but NOT SURE-> speed is constant but I attempted to made it 20rpm **note: the scale is about 3 which is less than 20%) Smoothly, continuously and 
	individually rotate and scale each of the cubes while the application is running. The rotation of each cube can be around any axis you choose. The rotation
 	speed should be constant and should be 20 rpm and the scale should vary by no more than twenty percent (20%) for their original size (scale can be either 
	smaller, larger or both, you decide). The cubes shall remain centered around their initial positions – 15 points.
